This was my Bachelor's Final Year Project. In this Project,
- I Created an android application called â€œSmart Kitchen" to monitor
inventory of kitchen and automatic grocery ordering
- Programmed Node MCU and integrated every sensor component into a
single framework and connected sensors to Adafruit IO server for storing
sensor values using MQTT protocol
- Implemented prototypes of Smart Container, Smart Fridge, Smart Bin and
LPG monitoring Systems
- Created dashboard in Adafruit IO server to view sensor values and to get
the sensor values and send it to android app
- This Project Won the IEEE Student Project Funding award and was funded
by IEEE Madras Section
